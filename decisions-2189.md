# Decisions — port the dates tab (#2189)

Decisions made while implementing. The scope, the import and config
mapping, the root providers and the test conventions are in #2189's plan
and are not repeated.

1. **The mock user is `MockUser` with a numeric id.** `master`'s test user
   is `{ userId: 'abc123', username: 'MockUser', roles: [], administrator: false }`;
   frontend-base's `User` type requires `userId: number`, `name` and
   `email`. The package's user keeps the username, since later ports'
   tests build URLs from it (product tours, courseware), and takes
   `userId: 123`, a name and an email to satisfy the type. It lives in
   `src/tests/authenticatedUser.ts`, imported by the setup file, so a test
   that needs the identity imports it from there rather than from the
   setup file as on `master`.

2. **Test helpers under `src/tests/` are excluded from coverage.** With
   `collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*']`, the query-client helpers counted
   as uncovered product lines before any page used them and tripped the
   96.15 threshold. They are test infrastructure like the setup file and
   the mocks, which the template already excludes, so `src/tests` joins
   `coveragePathIgnorePatterns`; the build already excludes the directory.

3. **Caret ranges for the two test dependencies.** `master` pins
   `axios-mock-adapter` to exactly `2.1.0`; the package takes npm's
   default `^2.1.0` (and `^13.2.0` for Pact), the caret convention the
   template and OEP-67 use. The exact pin dates from the dependency's
   arrival with the 2020 data integration tests (`eac9bf9c`) and was only
   ever moved by renovate (`19b8df35`, 2024-11-20), which keeps whatever
   range style it finds; no commit names a reason for it.

4. **The Pact consumer test is dropped, with its contract.** `master`'s
   `src/course-home/data/pact-tests/lmsPact.test.jsx` runs in the suite
   and was maintained (last touched by #2099), but what it produces is
   unconsumed: the contract it writes, `src/pacts/frontend-app-learning-lms.json`,
   is in merge mode and still carries interactions for courseware
   endpoints whose tests were deleted years ago and an old
   `/api/course_home/v1/course_metadata` path; nothing publishes or
   verifies it (openedx-platform's one Pact verifier,
   `lms/djangoapps/courseware/tests/pacts/verify_pact.py`, loads its own
   xblock-handler contract; `master` has no broker, stub script or CI
   step). The two functions it exercised are covered by `api.test.js`.
   The test, `src/pacts/constants.js` and the contract file get `dropped`
   manifest lines and `@pact-foundation/pact` is not added; a later layer
   can bring them back from `master`'s history if a provider-side
   verifier appears. The epic's "Pact is a per-port check" stands, with
   the check answered here.

5. **The app bundles a `defaultConfig` with the keys it reads, at `null`.**
   `getAppConfig(appId)` returns `undefined` for an app with no
   `defaultConfig`, no `config` and no site `commonAppConfig`, so
   `getAppConfig(appId).EXAMS_BASE_URL` threw in the first run of the
   ported data tests, and would throw at runtime on a site that sets
   nothing. Account and profile bundle their keys at `null` for this
   reason, and `null` is what `master`'s `mergeConfig` gave these keys
   (`process.env.X || null`). The epic's "only real defaults in
   `defaultConfig`" is read as "a key the app reads, with the value
   `master` defaulted it to"; `defaultConfig` sits below
   `commonAppConfig`, so it cannot shadow a site-wide value the way an
   app's own `config` would. This layer adds `ENABLE_NOTICES` and
   `EXAMS_BASE_URL`; each later layer adds the keys its files read.

6. **The real app is registered from the setup file, not the test site
   config.** Importing `learningApp` into `site.config.test.tsx` made the
   `provides` ids `undefined`: frontend-base's `initializeMockApp` imports
   `site.config` while frontend-base itself is still loading, so the
   app's imports from `@openedx/frontend-base` resolved to a half-built
   module. The test site config keeps the template's inline stub (the
   how-to's reason for it), and `setupTest.js` runs
   `mergeSiteConfig({ apps: [learningApp] })` before `addAppConfigs()`,
   after frontend-base is loaded, which is what profile's app test does
   locally. The stub's `config` survives the merge, so the test config
   is still where test-only values live.

7. **`.env.test` becomes the test site config.** `master`'s tests ran
   with `EXAMS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18740`, `LMS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:18000`
   and `BASE_URL=http://localhost:2000` from `.env.test`, and the hook
   tests filter requests by the exams-service URL shape. The test site
   config carries those three (`lmsBaseUrl`, `baseUrl`, and
   `EXAMS_BASE_URL` in the stub app's `config`), the way account's test
   config carries only the keys its tests rely on; later layers add
   theirs as their tests need them.

8. **The factories register from the setup file, and the shared course
   factories come with the course-home ones.** rosie factories exist
   only once their module runs; `master`'s setup file imports the
   factory index, so does the package's. The course-home factories
   import `shared/data/__factories__` (course metadata base, tabs,
   blocks), so those five files port here rather than with courseware;
   the `eslint-disable-line import/no-extraneous-dependencies` comments
   on their rosie imports go, since the base lint config has no `import`
   plugin and reports the unknown rule.
